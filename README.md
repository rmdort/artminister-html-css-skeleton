### What is this - Another CSS Framework?

This is not a css framework. This is core-basic html-css structure which i use to build websites for clients.

### Is this based on html5boilerplate from Paul Irish

Yes. The new files that i have added are

css/framework.css
index.html - Modified to add basic html

## Can i use these files without html5boiler plate

Yes sure. Only dependent file is css/style.css for browser resets
